This library helps you bridge a [BeeGo](http://beego.me) webapp with a 
[ng-admin](http://ng-admin-book.marmelab.com/index.html) CRUD interface
 
It offers a base REST controller and a base repository that can be used 
in your structs and provide all the functionality for CRUD operations in ng-admin,
including filtering and sorting.
